The server will respond to the Missed Message Request with a Missed Message Request Ack to indicate whether the recovery request is successful or not. If the request is unsuccessful, the reason will be specified in the field ResponseType. 
The total number of Missed Message Requests that a client may send on the Recovery channel is limited to Error: Reference source not found each day. Once this limit is reached, the server will reject any additional request via a Missed Message Request Ack with a ResponseType of Recovery Request limit reached (1).
In the case of a successful recovery request, the server will transmit the requested messages immediately after the Missed Message Request Ack. It should be noted that due to race conditions duplicate messages may be transmitted via the recovery channel. Clients are advised to use the AppID and SeqNum to carry out duplicate discard.
Missed Messages sent in response to a Missed Message Request will not contain the Order Mass Cancel Report message and Reject messages such as Order cancel rejects, business rejects, Mass Cancel request rejections and session rejects since these messages are not retained in Order Cash.
